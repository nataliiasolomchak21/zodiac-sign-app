# Zodiac Sign App

Zodiac Sign App is an interactive Python terminal program, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku and provides a variety of information related to your zodiac sign. When you open the Zodiac Sign App, you will be greeted and asked to enter your name. The program will then prompt you to provide your birth date, and use this to determine your zodiac sign. You can also choose from several other options to see predictions for your zodiac sign, check compatibility with other signs, see your sign's description, etc.
